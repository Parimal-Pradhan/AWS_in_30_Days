# Day-11: EFS - Concepts

#### **Real-time Story:**

Let’s consider a scenario where you are managing a **media streaming service** that hosts video content on AWS. The platform allows users to upload videos, and these videos need to be accessed by multiple application instances running in an **Auto Scaling group**. As the traffic grows, your app scales horizontally, and new instances are launched dynamically. Each instance needs access to the same set of video files to ensure a consistent user experience, but using Amazon EBS for this scenario is inefficient due to its limitations—EBS volumes can only be attached to a single EC2 instance at a time.

In this case, **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** is the perfect solution. It provides a fully managed, scalable file storage system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously across multiple Availability Zones.

#### **EFS Concepts**

Amazon **Elastic File System (EFS)** is a fully managed **network file system** that can be used to store and access data from **multiple EC2 instances** at the same time. It is designed to scale automatically as your data grows, with high availability and durability across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

Key Concepts of EFS:

- **File System Access**: EFS is a **network file system** that allows multiple EC2 instances to access the file system concurrently, which makes it ideal for applications that require shared access to data, such as web servers, content management systems, and media processing applications.

- **Scalability**: EFS automatically scales as the data grows, providing virtually unlimited storage. You don't have to worry about running out of space, as it grows in size as your storage needs increase.

- **Durability and Availability**: EFS stores data across multiple Availability Zones within a region, making it highly available and durable. If one AZ experiences an issue, your data remains accessible through other AZs.

- **Shared Storage**: Unlike Amazon EBS, which can only be attached to a single EC2 instance, **EFS** can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances, allowing them to read and write to the same data concurrently.

- **Performance Modes**:
  - **General Purpose**: Suitable for most applications. It offers low latency and high throughput for small and large files.
  - **Max I/O**: Designed for highly parallelized applications, where large amounts of data need to be accessed by many instances simultaneously.

- **Storage Classes**: EFS provides two storage classes:
  - **Standard**: For frequently accessed data.
  - **Infrequent Access (IA)**: For data that is not accessed as frequently, providing a lower cost option.

- **Security**: EFS integrates with **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and provides **encryption at rest and in transit** for secure data access.

- **NFS Protocol**: EFS is compatible with the **NFS (Network File System) protocol**, allowing it to be mounted on Linux-based EC2 instances using NFS client tools.

#### **Scenario: Using EFS for a Media Streaming Service**

Imagine you're building a **media streaming service** on AWS. The service allows users to upload videos, which are stored in EFS. These videos need to be accessed by multiple EC2 instances in the **Auto Scaling group**. Let’s walk through how you would set this up.

1. **Create an EFS File System**:
   - Go to the **EFS Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click **Create file system**.
   - Select your **VPC** and configure the **mount targets** for multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
   - Choose the **General Purpose** performance mode (since most users will frequently access videos).

2. **Set Up Security Groups and NFS Access**:
   - Make sure that your EC2 instances and EFS are in the same **VPC** and that the EC2 instances have the appropriate **security group** permissions to access EFS via the NFS protocol.
   - Modify the **security group** for the EFS file system to allow inbound connections on **port 2049** (the NFS port).

3. **Mount EFS on EC2 Instances**:
   - SSH into your EC2 instance.
   - Install the NFS client if not already installed:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install nfs-utils -y
     ```
   - Mount the EFS file system to a local directory (e.g., `/mnt/efs`):
     ```bash
     sudo mount -t nfs4 <EFS-DNS-NAME>:/ /mnt/efs
     ```

4. **Configure Auto Scaling to Access EFS**:
   - When your EC2 instances scale up (due to increased user traffic), each new EC2 instance can also mount the EFS file system and access the same data. This ensures that new instances have access to the uploaded media files, keeping the user experience consistent.

5. **Store and Retrieve Video Files**:
   - Users upload videos, and the application stores them in the `/mnt/efs/videos/` directory.
   - Any EC2 instance, whether it's handling user uploads or serving content to users, can access the video files stored in EFS.

6. **Scale Your Application**:
   - As more users upload videos, your Auto Scaling group adds more EC2 instances to handle the load. Each instance accesses the EFS file system for the video files without any issues since EFS is designed for shared access.

7. **Data Management**:
   - Over time, some videos may not be accessed as often. You can move these files to the **Infrequent Access (IA)** storage class in EFS to reduce storage costs. This transition is automatic when you set up lifecycle policies.

#### **Advantages of EFS in This Scenario:**

- **Shared Access**: Multiple EC2 instances can access the video files at the same time without needing to copy or sync the data between them.
- **Scalability**: As your application grows, you don’t need to manually manage storage. EFS grows automatically as more video files are uploaded.
- **High Availability**: Since EFS stores data across multiple Availability Zones, your media files are always accessible even if one AZ goes down.
- **Cost-Effective**: With the ability to use Infrequent Access storage, you can reduce costs for older, less frequently accessed data while keeping frequently accessed data readily available.

#### **Conclusion:**

In this real-world scenario, Amazon EFS enables you to build a highly available, scalable, and efficient file storage solution that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously. It is particularly useful for applications like media streaming, content management, and collaborative workloads where multiple servers need to access and share files without the overhead of managing file synchronization.
