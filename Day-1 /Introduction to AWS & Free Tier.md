### 🚀 What is AWS?
**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a **cloud platform** offered by Amazon. It provides over **200 services** like computing power, storage, databases, networking, machine learning, and more — all available over the internet.

### 🪜 Step-by-Step Concept:

- This is called **Cloud Computing**.

#### ✅ Step 2: Why Use AWS (Benefits)?
- **Cost-Effective** – Pay-as-you-go pricing. No upfront investment.
- **Scalable** – Start small and grow as needed (scale up/down).
- **Reliable** – 99.99% uptime, global infrastructure.
- **Secure** – Data encryption, IAM roles, compliance.
- **Fast Deployment** – Launch servers in minutes, not hours.

#### ✅ Step 3: Real-World Use Cases of AWS
- Hosting websites and web apps (like Netflix, Airbnb).
- Storing files and images (using S3).
- Running backend servers (using EC2).
- Sending notifications or emails (using SNS or SES).
- Analyzing big data (using Redshift, Athena).
